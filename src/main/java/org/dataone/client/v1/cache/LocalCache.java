/**
 * LocalCache creates a local store of objects that can be locally accessed without
 * incurring the overhead of remote service calls.  Two types of caches are created,
 * one for immutable DataONE objects (data, science metadata, and ORE packages), and
 * one for mutable SystemMetadata objects.  Each is accessed using different get/put methods.
 * The singleton is created on first use of the instance() method, which initializes 
 * the local caches.  LocalCache uses both an in-memory LRU cache for frequently accessed
 * objects, and a longer-lived disk-based auxiliary cache for objects that have been 
 * expired from the in-memory cache.  The configuration of these caches, their expiration 
 * policies, and disk locations are determined from the cache.ccf properties file.
